# COVID-19-Return-to-the-Office-Analysis

Managed the complete data survey, processing, and analysis process for the company regarding staff sentiment about returning to/working from the office.

Goal:

After meeting with fellow team leads, I was tasked to create a visualization that helped C-level decision makers understand how their staff felt about returning to physical office spaces. The timeline to create the data collection method, clean the data, and then produce a visualization was a total of five working days. 

Methodology:

Given the time restraints, I decided to use a Google survey instead of my preferred data collection method of Qualtrics. Sometimes I prefer to use Google surveys over Qualtrics, especially when information needs to be gathered quickly so decisions can be made as soon as possible! Once the survey was launched, I used the first sets of data that trickled in to start creating my visualization in Tableau. Finally, once the Tableau report was completed, I permissioned the report through SQL to conduct further analysis and share the visualization.

Final Report:

The final report had two visualizations. The first one was a macro-level view that displayed whether staff were willing or unwilling to return to the offce, this was also broken down by job function and title.
